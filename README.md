# CerebroClassify ðŸ§ 

An advanced web application that utilizes a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **Healthy**. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to upload MRI images and receive predictions with confidence scores.

## **Demo**

Try the live demo: **[CerebroClassify Live Demo](https://your-demo-link.com)**

*(Replace the above link with the actual URL if you deploy the app)*

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 - 3.10
- Git installed on your local machine

### **Create a Virtual Environment**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scriptsctivate
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Download the Model File**

Place your trained model file `brain_tumor_classifier.h5` in the project directory. Ensure that the model file is compatible with the code.

## **Usage**

### **Run the Application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Using the App**

- Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).
- Upload an MRI image in JPG or PNG format.
- Click on **Predict** to get the classification results.
- View detailed explanations and confidence scores.
- Download the report if you wish to save the results.

- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `images/`: Directory for images used in the README or app.

## **Model Details**

The deep learning model is based on DenseNet201, a pre-trained convolutional neural network from Keras Applications. The model has been fine-tuned to classify brain MRI images into the following categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- Healthy

### **Training Dataset**

The model was trained on a dataset containing MRI images labeled with the four categories. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques were used to enhance performance.

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.7 - 3.10
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Altair

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Future Work**

- Expand Classification Categories: Include more types of brain tumors and conditions.
- Improve Model Accuracy: Continuously update the model with more data and better techniques.
- Deploy on Cloud Platform: Make the app accessible online for wider use.
- Add Multi-Language Support: Cater to non-English speaking users.

## **Screenshots**

- Home Page
- Prediction Results

(Add actual screenshots of your app in the `images/` directory and update the image paths accordingly.)

## **How It Works**

1. **Upload**: Users upload an MRI image through the app interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: The image is preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model (resizing, normalization).
3. **Prediction**: The pre-trained model processes the image and outputs probabilities for each class.
4. **Results Display**: The app displays the predicted class, confidence scores, and additional information.
5. **Report Generation**: Users can download a report containing the results.

## **Technical Details**

- **Framework**: The app is built using Streamlit, allowing for rapid development of data apps.
- **Model Loading**: Utilizes `@st.cache_resource` to load the model efficiently and prevent unnecessary reloads.
- **Visualization**: Employs Altair for interactive and responsive charts.
- **Error Handling**: Implements `try-except` blocks to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

## **Security Considerations**

- **File Handling**: Uploaded images are processed in memory and not saved to disk.
- **User Data**: No personal data is collected or stored.
- **Dependencies**: All libraries used are widely adopted and regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

1. **Can I use this app for medical diagnosis?**

   No. This app is intended for educational purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

2. **What types of images are supported?**

   The app supports MRI images in JPG and PNG formats.

3. **How accurate is the model?**

   The model's accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training data. While it performs well on the dataset it was trained on, it may not generalize perfectly to all real-world data.

4. **Is my uploaded data secure?**

   Yes. The app does not store any uploaded images or personal data. All processing is done locally on your machine when running the app.
